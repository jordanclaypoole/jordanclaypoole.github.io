		<div id = "me">
		<p>My name is Jordan Claypoole and my planned graduation is in the spring of two thousand twenty. I attend Armstrong Senior and Junior High School.
			In the future I would like to go to college and get my criminology degree. I want to become a state cop in the future as well. I've always wanted to be a state cop. I want to be
			a state cop because I like helping people and serving for my community. I would also like to get married and start a family. My future plans and goals
			are influenced by my skills, experiences, and interest. I also hunt and fish.
			In my free time I like to watch sports like baseball,soccer, and football. I also like to play soccer, play baseball, and ride dirt bikes.
			These are my hobbies.  These are all of my interest and future plans and goals.</p>
