		This has also gave me experience with organizing groups of people to help the team win or complete and objective.
		Goalkeeping demonstrates my skill to concentrate under high stress conditions.</p>

		<p> I've played guitar since two thousand thirteen. A guitar player has many jobs. The guitar player must practice daily and take care of his guitar.
			I joined a band in two thousand seventeen. In a band a guitar player can keep 
			beat with the drums or they can play solos. I play solos so my job is to bring a melody to the song
			Playing guitar shows many of my skills. One of those skills are that I can improvise and make a plan on the spot. 
			Playing guitar also shows my artistic ability to make a song come to life off a peace of paper.
